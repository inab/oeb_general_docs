# Legal Framework 
## Considerations for Compliance and Implementation  
The following sections outline the general considerations of the legal framework applicable to ensure that the defined strategy complies with relevant regulations. These considerations help in preparing the necessary agreements and reference documents to facilitate implementation while maintaining legal and ethical integrity.  

## Data Privacy & Protection  
Compliance with GDPR and other regional regulations is essential when handling sensitive biological and patient data. To ensure security and confidentiality, datasets should be anonymized and encrypted before use.  

## Intellectual Property (IP) & Licensing  
It is important to clarify data ownership and licensing terms. Depending on the challenge, models and results can either be open-source, following licenses such as Apache 2.0, MIT, or Creative Commons, or proprietary, requiring restricted access and usage rights.  

## Data Sharing & Usage Agreements  
The Terms of Use should clearly define permissible data usage and the handling of shared datasets within the benchmarking event. Additionally, the OpenEBench platformâ€™s Terms of Use should be considered. To promote transparency and accessibility, datasets should align with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles.  

## Ethical Considerations & Bias Mitigation  
The challenge must adhere to established ethical guidelines for bioinformatics research, such as those outlined by NIH and EMBL-EBI. Furthermore, bias detection and mitigation strategies should be explicitly implemented in datasets and AI models to ensure fairness and reliability.   

## Competition Rules & Governance  
Clear participation criteria should be established, ensuring that all participants provide informed consent. The evaluation process must be well-defined, including assessment methodologies for scientific benchmarking, technical performance, and sustainability metrics. Additionally, potential disqualification reasons, such as misconduct or data manipulation, should be outlined to maintain the integrity of the competition.  

## Publication & Results Disclosure  
It is necessary to specify whether the results will be publicly available, for example, through journal publications or open repositories. Furthermore, proper attribution should be defined, ensuring participants receive due recognition for their contributions, such as co-authorship or citation requirements.  

## Liability & Disclaimers  
The organizers' liability should be limited concerning any misuse of data or errors in datasets. Additionally, disclaimers should be included, stating that no guarantees are provided regarding data accuracy or its suitability for a particular purpose.
