OpenEBench Repository Hub
#########################

OpenEBench-related code repositories are mainly stored at `GitHub <https://github.com/>`__, under different organizations and groups, but always inter-linked and accessible though the documentation hub. It gathers in a comprehensive manner the code repositories of OpenEBench core components (*i.e*, platforms, APIs, widgets,...), as well as benchmarking workflows developed by enrolled scientific communities, or the benchmarking compoments developed by third party projects supported by OpenEBench. The OpenEBench repository hub can be found `here <https://github.com/inab/openebench-hub>`__.

Add a new repository to the OpenEBench Repository Hub
=====================================================

The addition of new GitHub repositories to the Hub is automated. The requirement is to add **"OpenEBench"** as one of the topics of your repository. Shortly, the new repository will be displayed at the Hub. Follow the official GitHub
documentation on `how to add topics to your repository <https://docs.github.com/es/github/administering-a-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics#adding-topics-to-your-repository>`__.
