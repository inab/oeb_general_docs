# Benchmarking Perspectives

In bioinformatics, benchmarking activities can be considered from three
perspectives; the technical, the scientific and the functional ones:

-   **Technical benchmarking** usually focuses on technical quality
     metrics, such as, for instance, whether it can be compiled with no
     errors, resources needed along the execution (storage, memory),
     the reproducibility of the results, and portability, among others.
     In the case of services, relevant features are accessibility,
     up-time, communication protocols, response time, processing speed,
     and interoperability.

-   **Scientific benchmarking**, on the other hand, determines the
     performance of bioinformatics resources in the context of
     predefined reference datasets and metrics reflecting specific
     scientific challenges. Some metrics relate to experimental
     readouts used as standards of truth while others merely quantify
     some level of optimization. Those metrics allow to objectively
     evaluate the relative scientific performance of the different
     participating tools and, what is more, with a deep scientific
     knowledge and substantial information about the corresponding
     tools it is even possible to understand what are the tools
     potential biases, strengths and weaknesses or under which
     conditions do tools underperform. What is more, benchmarking can
     also provide quality control for new resources or releases of
     established resources; often, developers present a new tool and,
     once it is challenged in a benchmarking event, they decide not
     make their results publicly available, presumably after
     discovering poor outcome in some of the benchmarks. This clearly
     demonstrates the effectiveness of a community benchmarking service
     for quality control.

-   **Functional benchmarking** performs a user-based evaluation of
     software usability. Some relevant aspects that determine the
     usability of a given software are: how intuitive and easy-to-use
     is the interface; if there exists clear and comprehensive user
     documentation; whether software customizes the user experience
     according to predefined roles when more than one profile is
     available; whether it is linked to data repositories that are
     updated frequently; if there are communities around the software
     aiming to support users and/or developers; whether the software is
     open source and licenses are properly indicated.
