##########################

EUDAT is an European project to develop a Collaborative Data Infrastructure (CDI) which provides means for managing large distributed collection of digital objects, maintaining metadata and applying data management policies. 

B2SHARE is the EUDAT user-friendly, reliable and trustworthy service for researchers, scientific communities and citizen scientists to store and publish research data from diverse contexts. More information: `EUDAT-B2SHARE <https://eudat.eu/services/b2share>`_.


Using the Virtual Research Environment
######################################

OpenEBench offers a Graphical User Interface to upload benchmarking data to B2SHARE remote repository. 
B2SHARE is distributed in communities. OpenEBench has its own community there. Using the Virtual Reaserach Enviroment to upload data in B2SHARE, it will be push it in the OpenEBench community (`OpenEBench community <https://b2share.eudat.eu/communities/OpenEBench#>`_).

What benchmkarking data can be published?
=========================================
- Participant dataset
- Participant Assessments dataset
- Aggregation dataset (once benchmarking event is closed, done by event manager)

Prerequisites
=============
In order to publish your data in EUDAT OpenEBench community, it is necessary to link your Eudat account in Virtual Research Enviroment:  

First you need to register in EUDAT and generate an access token. (`Generate Eudat token <https://eudat.eu/services/userdoc/b2share-http-rest-api#Creating_an_access_token>`_). Afterwards, you can easily link your Eudat account in VRE, going to your profile / keys tab.
